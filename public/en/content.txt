🚀 About Me
</title>
Hi! I'm <style text-purple-500>Refil</style>, a passionate programmer with <style text-pink-500>3 years of programming experience</style>. My programming journey began in <style text-purple-400>2022</style> with Python, but fun fact — I have had a GitHub account since <style text-pink-400>2019</style>, which means I might have started even earlier!

As a prompt engineer and programmer, I specialize in <style text-purple-600>Python, JavaScript, and PHP</style>. Currently, I am developing my skills in <style text-pink-600>Java, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind.css, and C#</style>, always staying up to date.

💻 What I'm Working On

Currently, I am focusing on building full-stack applications with Next.js and developing several exciting projects.
