🚀 About Me
</title>
Hey! I'm <style text-purple-500>Refil</style>, a passionate developer with <style text-pink-500>3 years of programming experience</style>. My coding journey started in <style text-purple-400>2022</style> with Python, but fun fact — I’ve had a GitHub account since <style text-pink-400>2019</style>, meaning I could’ve started even earlier!

As a Prompt Engineer & Developer, I specialize in <style text-purple-600>Python, JavaScript, and PHP</style>. Currently, I’m leveling up with <style text-pink-600>Java, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind.css, and C#</style>, always staying ahead of the curve.

💻 What I'm Working On

Right now, I'm focused on building full-stack Next.js applications while developing several exciting projects.
